% \subsection{Field extensions}
  \begin{tproposition}
    Suppose that \( L \) is a field extension of \( K \) with associated embedding \( \vphi: K \to L \).
    Then \( L \) forms a vector space over \( K \), under the operations
    \begin{align*}
      \nf{(vector addition) } \psi: L\times L &\to L \quad \text{given by} \quad (v_1,v_2) \mapsto v_1 + v_2 \\
      \nf{(scalar multiplication) } \tau : K\times  L &\to L \quad \text{given by} \quad (k,v) \mapsto \vphi(k)v.
    \end{align*}
  \end{tproposition}

  \begin{ttheorem}[The Tower Law]
    Suppose that \( M :L: K \) is a tower of field extensions.
    Then \( M : K \) is a field extension, and
    \begin{align*}
      [M : K] = [M : L][L: K].
    \end{align*}
  \end{ttheorem}

  \begin{tcorollary}
    Suppose that \( L:K \) is a field extension for which \( [L: K] \) is a prime number.
    Then whenever \( L : M : K \) is a tower of field extensions with \( K \subeq M \subeq L \), one has either \( M= L \tor M= K \).
  \end{tcorollary}

% \subsection{Algebraic elements}
  \begin{tproposition}
    Suppose that \( K \) and \( L \) are fields and that \( \vphi : K \to L \) is a \homo. With \( t \) and \( y \) denoting indeterminates, extend the \homo~\( \vphi \) to the mapping \( \psi: K[t] \to L[y] \) by defining
    \begin{align*}
      \psi(a_0 + a_1t+\cdots + a_n t^n) = \vphi(a_0) + \vphi(a_1)y+\cdots + \vphi(a_n)y^n.
    \end{align*}
    Then \( \psi:K[t]\to L[y] \) is an injective \homo. Also, when \( \vphi:K\to L \) is surjective, then \( \psi \) is surjective and maps irreducible polynomials in \( K[t] \) to irreducible polynomials in \( L[y] \).
  \end{tproposition}

    \end{align*}
    and

  \end{ttheorem}

  \begin{ttheorem}[Eisenstein's Criterion]
    Suppose that \( R \) is a UFD, and that \( f=a_0+a_1X+\ldots+a_nX^n \in R[X] \) is primitive. Then provided that there is an irreducible element \( p \) of \( R \) having the property that
