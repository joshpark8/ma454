\section{Solvability by radicals and Galois theory II}
\begin{tlemma}
  Let \( p \) be prime and \( G\sgp S_p \) such that \( G \) acts transitivley on \( \left\{ 1,\dots,p \right\} \).
  Then \( G \) contains a cycle of order \( p \).
\end{tlemma}

\begin{ttheorem}
  Let \( \chr K = 0 \) and \( f\in K[t]\setminus K \).
  Then \( \Gal_K(f) \) is soluble \( \imp \) \( f \) is SBR.
\end{ttheorem}

\begin{tlemma}[Wooley 14.8]
  Let \( \chr K = 0 \), and suppose that \( L:K \) is a cyclic extension of degree \( n \).
  Suppose also that \( K \) contains a primitive \( n \)-th root of 1.
  Then there exists \( \theta \in K \) having the property that \( t^n -\theta \) is irreducible over \( K \), and \( L:K \) is a \sf~for \( t^n-\theta \).
  Further, if \( \beta \) is a root of \( t^n-\theta \) over \( L \), then \( L=K(\beta) \).
\end{tlemma}

\begin{ttheorem}[Abel-Galois]
  Let \( \chr K = 0 \) and \( f\in K[t] \) be irreducible over \( K \) with \( \deg f = p \).
  Then following are equivalent
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \( f \) is SBR over \( K \);
    \item \( \Gal_K(f) \) is conjugated to a subgroup of \( \Aff(\FF p) \);
    \item for the splitting field \( L \) of \( f \), one has \( L = K(\alpha_i,\alpha_j) \) where \( \alpha_i,\alpha_j \) are any two destinct roots of \( f \).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ttheorem}

\begin{tlemma}
  Let \( \tgp \neq N \nsgp G \sgp S_p \) for \( p \) prime.
  If \( G \) is a transitive group, then \( N \) is a transitive group.
\end{tlemma}
